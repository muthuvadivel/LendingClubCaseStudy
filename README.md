## General Information
Lending Club case study objective is to do study and analyze the defaulted loan patterns from given loan dataset. The intent of this analysis is to find the factors which influence the loan default which means finding various
customer and loan attributes contributing to loan default. Knowing this will help in being considering these factors in future loan grants in order to reduce this loan default count. Please refer the ppt attached for more details 
how the analysis done and what are all various outcomes

## Conclusions
* Loans with lesser tenure of 36 months have a high chance of defaulting loan might be due to High EMI per month
* Customers who have Rented house or Mortgaged their home tends to default loan
* Customers with annual income of less than 50k has a high chance of defaulting loan might be due to less salary
* Verified customers defaulted loan than non-verified customers - this shows there could be a lapse in verification process or might be due to corruption involved in this process of verifying customers. Needs further investigation
* Customers who got loan for Debt Consolidation purpose defaulted loan heavily, this could be due to heavy loan amount as they were consolidating multiple loans. Need to be careful in lending those customers as they might tend to get heavy loan which they couldnâ€™t pay back
